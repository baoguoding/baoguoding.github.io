The Scroll Marked Six

第六道羊皮卷

[6:1]

Today I will be master of my emotions.

今天我要学会控制情绪。

[6:2]

The tides advance; the tides recede. Winter goes and summer comes. summer wanes and the cold increases. The sun rises; the sun sets. The moon is full; the moon is black. The birds arrive; the birds depart. Flowers bloom; flowers fade. Seeds are sown; harvests are reaped. all nature is a circle of moods and I am a part of nature and so, like the tides, my moods will rise; my moods will fall.

潮起潮落，冬去春来，夏末秋至，日出日落，月圆月缺，雁来雁往，花飞花谢，草长瓜熟，自然界万物都在循环往复的变化中，我也不例外，情绪会时好时坏。

[6:3]

Today I will be master of my emotions.

今天我要学会控制情绪。

[6:4]

It is one of nature's tricks, little understood, that each day I awaken with moods that have changed from yesterday. Yesterday's joy wilI become today's sadness; yet today's sadness will grow into tomorrow's joy. Inside me is a wheel, constantly turning from sadness to joy, from exultation to depression, from happiness to melancholy. Like the flowers, today's full bloom of joy will fade and wither into despondency, yet I will remember that as today's dead flower carries the seed of tomorrow's bloom so, too, does today's sadness carry the seed of tomorrow's joy.

这是大自然的玩笑，很少有人窥破天机。每天我醒来时，不再有旧日的心绪。昨日的快乐变成今日的哀愁，今日的悲伤又转为明日的喜悦。我心中像一只轮子不停地转着，由乐而悲，由悲而喜，由喜而忧。这就好比花儿的变化，今天绽放的喜悦也会变成凋谢时的绝望，但是我要记住，正如今天枯败的花儿蕴藏着明天新生的种子，今天的悲伤也预示着明天的快乐。

[6:5]

Today I will be master of my emotions.

今天我要学会控制情绪。

[6:6]

And how will I master these emotions so that each day will be productive? For unless my mood is right the day will be a failure. Trees and plants depend on the weather to flourish but I make my own weather, yea I transport it with me. If I bring rain and gloom and darkness and pessimism to my customers then they will react with rain and gloom and darkness and pessimism and they will purchase naught. If I bring joy and enthusiasm and brightness and laughter to my customers they will react with joy and enthusiasm and brightness and laughter and my weather will produce a harvest of sales and a granary of gold for me.

我怎样才能控制情绪，以使每天卓有成效呢？除非我心平气和，否则迎来的又将是失败的一天。花草树木，随着气候的变化而生长，但是我为自己创造天气。我要学会用自己的心灵弥补气候的不足。如果我为顾客带来风雨、忧郁、黑暗和悲观，那么他们也会报之于风雨、忧郁、黑暗和悲观，而他们什么也不会买。相反的，如果我们为顾客献上欢乐、喜悦、光明和笑声，他们也会报之以欢乐、喜悦、光明和笑声，我就能获得销售上的丰收，赚取成仓的金币。

[6:7]

Today I will be master of my emotions.

今天我要学会控制情绪。

[6:8]

And how will I master my emotions so that every day is a happy day, and a productive one? I will learn this secret of the ages: Weak is he who permits his thoughts to control his actions; strong is he who forces his actions to control his thoughts. Each day, when I awaken, I will follow this plan of battle before I am captured by the forces of sadness, self-pity and failure-

我怎样才能控制情绪，让每天充满幸福和欢乐？我要学会这个千古秘诀：弱者任思绪控制行为，强者让行为控制思绪。每天醒来当我被悲伤、自怜、失败的情绪包围时，我就这样与之抗衡：

[6:9]

If I feel depressed I will sing.

沮丧时，我引吭高歌。

[6:10]

If I feel sad I will laugh.

[6:11]

If I feel ill I will double my labor.

[6:12]

If I feel fear I will plunge ahead.

恐惧时，我勇往直前。

[6:13]

If I feel inferior I will wear new garments.

[6:18]

Today I will be master of my emotions. 

总之，今天我要学会控制自己的情绪。

[6:19]

Henceforth, I will know that only those with inferior ability can always be at their best, and I am not inferior. There will be days When I must IN THE WORLD constantly struggle against forces which would tear me down. Those such as despair and sadness are simple to recognize but there are others which approach with a smile and the hand of friendship and they can also destroy me. Against them, too, I must never relinquish control.

从今往后，我明白了，只有低能者才会江郎才尽，我并非低能者，我必须不断对抗那限些企图摧垮我的力量。失望与悲伤一眼就能被识破，而其它许多敌人是不易察觉的。它们往往面带微笑，招手而来，却随时可能将我摧毁。对它们，我永远不能放松警惕。

[6:20]

If I become overconfident I will recall my failures.

自高自大时，我要追寻失败的记忆。

[6:26]

[6:28]

今天我要学会控制情绪。

[6:29]

And with this new knowledge I will also understand and recognize the moods of him on whom I call. I will make allowances for his anger and irritation of today for he knows not the secret of controlling his mind. I can withstand his arrows and insults for now I know that tomorrow he will change and be a joy to approach.

有了这项新本领，我也更能体察别人的情绪变化。我宽容怒气冲冲的人，因为他尚未懂得控制自己的情绪，就可以忍受他的指责与辱骂，因为我知道明天他会改变，重新变得随和。

[6:30]

No longer will I judge a man on one meeting; no longer will I fail to call again tomorrow on he who meets me with hate today. This day he will not buy gold chariots for a penny, yet tomorrow he would exchange his home for a tree. My knowledge of this secret will be my key to great wealth.

我不再只凭一面之交来判断一个人，也不再因一时的怨恨与人绝交，今天不肯花一分钱购买金蓬马车的人，明天也许会用全部家当来换取树苗。知道这个秘密，我可以获得极大的财富。

[6:31]

Today l will be master of my emotions.

今天我要学会控制自己的情绪。

[6:32]

我从此领悟人类情绪的变化的奥秘。对于自己千变万化的个性，我不再听之任之，我知道，只有积极主动地控制情绪，才能掌握自己的命运。

[6:33]
