I will pray for guidance.

我祈求主的指引 

[10:1]

Who is of so little faith that in a moment of great disaster or heartbreak has not called to his God? Who has not cried out when confronted with danger, death, or mystery beyond his normal experience or comprehension? From where has this deep instinct come which escapes from the mouth of all living creatures in moments of peril?

即使没有信仰的人，遇到灾难的时候，不是也呼求神的保佑吗？一个人在面临危险、死亡或一些未见过或无法理解的神秘之事时，不曾失声大喊吗？每一个生灵在危险的刹那都会脱口而出的这种强烈的本能是何而生的呢？

[10:2]

Move your hand in haste before another's eyes and his eyelids will blink. Tap another on his knee and his leg will jump. Confront another with dark horror and his mouth will say,"My God" from the same deep impulse.

把你的手在别人眼前出其不意地挥一下，你会发现他的眼睑本能地一眨；在他的膝盖上轻轻一击，他的腿会跳动；在黑暗中吓一个朋友，他会本能地大叫一声“天呀”。

[10:3]

My life need not be filled with religion in order for me to recognize this greatest mystery of nature. All creatures that walk the earth, including man, possess the instinct to cry for help. Why do we possess this instinct, this gift?

不管你有没有宗教信仰，这些自然现象谁也无法否认。世上的所有生物，包括人类，都具有求助的本能。为什么我们会有这种本能，这种恩赐呢？

[10:4]

Are not our cries a form of prayer? Is it not incomprehensible in a world governed by nature's laws to give a lamb, or a mule, or a bird, or man the instinct to cry out for help lest some great mind has also provided that the cry should be heard by some superior power having the ability to hear and to answer our cry? Henceforth I will pray, but my cries for help will only be cries for guidance.

我们发出的喊声，不是一种祈祷的方式吗？人们无法理解，在一个受自然法则统治的世界里，上苍将这种求救的本能赐于了羊、驴子、小鸟、人类，同时也规定这种求救的声音应被一种超凡的力量听到并作出回应。从今往后，我要祈祷，但是我只求指点迷津。 

[10:5]

Never will I pray for the material things of the world. I am not calling to a servant to bring me food. I am not ordering an innkeeper to provide me with room. Never will I seek delivery of gold, love, good health, petty victories, fame, success, or happiness. Only for guidance will I pray, that I may be shown the way to acquire these things, and my prayer will always be answered.

我从不求物质的满足。我不祈求有仆人为我送来食物，不求屋舍、金银财宝、爱情、健康、小的胜利、名誉、成功或者幸福。我只求得到指引，指引我获得这些东西的途径，我的祈祷都有回音。

[10:6]

The guidance I seek may come, or the guidance I seek may not come, but are not both of these an answer? If a child seeks bread from his father and it is not forthcoming has not the father answered?

我所祈求的指引，可能得到，也可能得不到，但这两种结果都不是回音？如果一个孩子回答爸爸要面包，面包没有到手，这也不是父亲的答复吗？

[10:7]

I will pray for guidance, and I will pray as a salesman, in this manner Oh creator of all things, help me. For this day I go out into the world naked and alone, and without your hand to guide me I will wander far from the path which leads to success and happiness.

 我要祈求指导，以一个推销员的身份来祈祷。万能的主啊，帮助我吧！今天，我独自一人，赤条条地来到这个世上，没有你的双手指引，我将远离通向成功与幸福的道路。

[10:8]

I ask not for gold or garments or even opportunities equal to my ability; instead, guide me so that I may acquire ability equal to my opportunities.

我不求金钱或衣衫，甚至不求适合我的能力的机遇，我只求您引导我获得适合机遇的能力。

[10:9]

You have taught the lion and the eagle how to hunt and prosper with teeth and claw. Teach me how to hunt with words and prosper with love so that I may be a lion among men and an eagle in the market place.

您曾经教狮子和雄鹰如何利用牙齿和利爪觅食。求您教给我如何利用言赐谋生，如何借助爱心得以兴旺，使我能成为人中的狮子，商场上的雄鹰。

[10:10]

Help me to remain humble through obstacles and failures; yet hide not from mine eyes the prize that will come with victory.

帮助我！让我经历挫折和失败后仍能谦恭待人，让我看见胜利的奖赏。

[10:11]

Assign me tasks to which others have failed; yet guide me to pluck the seeds of success from their failures. Confront me with fears that will temper my spirit; yet endow me with courage to laugh at my misgivings.

把别人不能完成的工作交给我，指引我由他们的失败中，拮取成功的种子。让我面对恐惧，好磨炼我的精神。给我勇气嘲笑自己的疑虑和胆怯。 

[10:12]

Spare me sufficient days to reach my goals; yet help me to live this day as though it be my last.

赐给我足够的时间，好让我达到目标。帮助我珍惜每日如最后一天。

[10:13]

Guide me in my words that they may bear fruit; yet silence me from gossip that none be maligned.

引导我言出必行，行之有果。让我在流言蜚语中保持缄默。

[10:14]

Discipline me in the habit of trying and trying again; yet show me the way to make use of the law of averages. Favor me with alertness to recognize opportunity; yet endow me with patience which will concentrate my strength.

鞭策我，让我养成一试再试的习惯。教我使用平衡法则的方法。让我保持敏感，得以抓住机会。赐给我耐心，得以集中力量。

[10:15]

Bathe me in good habits that the bad ones may drown; yet grant me compassion for weaknesses in others. Suffer me to know that all things shall pass; yet help me to count my blessings of today.

让我养成良好的习惯，戒除不良嗜好。赐给我同情心，同情别人的弱点。让我知道，一切都将过去，却也能计算每日的恩赐。

[10:16]

Expose me to hate so it not be a stranger; yet fill my cup with love to turn strangers into friends.

让我看出何谓仇恨，使我对它不再陌生。但让我充满爱心，使陌生人变成朋友。

[10:17]

But all these things be only if thy will. I am a small and a lonely grape clutching the vine yet thou hast made me different from all others. Verily, there must be a special place for me. Guide me. Help me. Show me the way.

但这一切祈求都要合乎您的意思。我只是个微不足道的人物，如那孤零零挂在藤上的葡萄。然而您使我与众不同。事实上，我必须有一个特别的位置。指引我，帮助我。让我看到前方的路。

[10:18]

Let me become all you planned for me when my seed was planted and selected by you to sprout in the vineyard of the world.

当您把我种下，让我在世界的葡萄圆里发芽，让我成为我计划的一切。

[10:19]

Help this humble salesman. 

帮助我这个谦卑的推销员吧！

[10:20]

Guide me,God.

主啊，指引我！
