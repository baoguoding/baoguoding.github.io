The Scroll Marked IV

第四道羊皮卷

[4:1]

I am nature's greatest miracle. 

我是自然界最伟大的奇迹。

[4:2]

Since the beginning of time never has there been another with my mind, my heart, my eyes, my ears, my hands, my hair, my mouth. None that came before, none that live today, and none that come tomorrow can walk and talk and move and think exactly like me. All men are my brothers yet I am different from each. I am a unique creature. 

自从上帝创造了天地万物以来，没有一个人和我一样，我的头脑、心灵、眼睛、耳朵、双手、头发、嘴唇都是与众不同的。言谈举止和我完全一样的人以前没有，现在没有，以后也不会有．虽然四海之内皆兄弟，然而人人各异。我是独一无二的造化。

[4:3]

I am nature's greatest miracle. 

我是自然界最伟大的奇迹。

[4:4]

Although I am of the animal kingdom, animal rewards alone will not satisfy me. Within me burns a flame, which has been passed from generations uncounted and its heat is a constant irritation to my spirit to become better than I am, and I will. I will fan this flame of dissatisfaction and proclaim my uniqueness to the world. 

我不可能像动物一样容易满足，我心中燃烧着代代相传的火焰，它激励我超越自己，我要使这团火燃得更旺，向世界宣布我的出类拔萃。

[4:5]

None can duplicate my brush strokes, none can make my chisel marks, none can duplicate my handwriting, none can produce my child, and, in truth, none has the ability to sell exactly as I. Henceforth, I will capitalize on this difference for it is an asset to be promoted to the fullest. 

没有人能模仿我的笔迹，我的商标，我的成果，我的推销能力。从今往后，我要使自己的个性充分发展，因为这是我得以成功的一大资本。

[4:6]

I am nature's greatest miracle. 

我是自然界最伟大的奇迹。

[4:7]

Vain attempts to imitate others no longer will I make. Instead will I place my uniqueness on display in the market place. I will proclaim it, yea, I will sell it. I will begin now to accent my differences; hide my similarities. So too will I apply this principle to the goods I sell. Salesman and goods, different from all others, and proud of the difference. 

我不再徒劳地模仿别人，而要展示自己的个性。我不但要宣扬它，还要推销它。我要学会去同存异，强调自己与众不同之处，回避人所共有的通性，并且要把这种原则运用到商品上。推销员和货物，两者皆独树一帜，我为此而自豪。

[4:8]

I am a unique creature of nature. 

我是独一无二的奇迹。

[4:9]

I am rare, and there is value in all rarity; therefore, I am valuable. I am the end product of thousands of years of evolution; therefore, I am better equipped in both mind and body than all the emperors and wise men who preceded me. 

物以稀为贵，我独行特立，因而身价百倍。我是千万年进化的终端产物，头脑和身体都超过以往的帝王与智者。

[4:10]

But my skills, my mind, my heart, and my body will stagnate, rot, and die lest I put them to good use. I have unlimited potential. Only a small portion  of my brain do I employ; only a paltry amount of my muscles do I flex. A hundredfold or more can I increase my accomplishments of yesterday  and this I will do, beginning today. 

但是，我的技艺，我的头脑，我的心灵，我的身体，若不善加利用，都将随着时间的流逝而迟钝，腐朽，甚至死亡。我的潜力无穷无尽，脑力、体能稍加开发，就能超过以往的任何成就。从今天开始。我就要开发潜力。

[4:11]

Nevermore will I be satisfied with yesterday's accomplishments nor will I indulge, anymore, in self-praise for deeds which in reality are too small to even acknowledge. I can accomplish far more than I have, and I will, for why should the miracle  which produced me end with my birth? Why can I not extend that miracle to my deeds of today? 

我不再因昨日的成绩沾沾自喜，不再为微不足道的成绩目吹自擂。我能做的比已经完成的更好。我的出生并非最后一样奇迹，为什么自己不能再创奇迹呢？

[4:12]

I am nature's greatest miracle. 

我是自然界最伟大的奇迹。

[4:13]

I am not on this earth by chance. I am here for a purpose and that purpose is to grow into a mountain, not to shrink to a grain of sand. Henceforth will I apply all my efforts to become the highest mountain of all and I will strain my potential until it cries for mercy. 

我不是随意来到这个世上的。我生来应为高山，而非草芥。从今往后，我要竭尽全力成为群峰之巅，将我的潜能发挥到最大限度。

[4:14]

I will increase my knowledge of mankind, myself, and the goods I sell, thus my sales will multiply. I will practice, and improve, and polish the words I utter to sell my goods, for this is the foundation on which I will build my career and never will I forget that many have attained great wealth and success with only one sales talk, delivered with excellence. Also will I seek constantly to improve my manners and graces, for they are the sugar to which all are attracted. 

我要汲取前人的经验，了解自己以及手中的货物，这样才能成倍地增加销量。我要字斟句酌，反复推敲推销时用的语言。因为这是成就事业的关键。我绝不忘记，许多成功的商人，其实只有一套说词。却能使他们无往不利。我也要不断改进自己的仪态和风度，因为这是吸引别人的美德。

[4:15]

I am nature's greatest miracle. 

我是自然界里最伟大的奇迹。

[4:16]

I will concentrate my energy on the challenge of the moment and my actions will help me forget all else. The problems of my home will be left in my home. I will think naught of my family when I am in the market place for this will cloud my thoughts. So too will the problems of the market place be left in the market place and I will think naught of my profession when I am in my home for this will dampen my love. 

我要专心致志对抗眼前的挑战，我的行动会使我忘却其它一切，不让家事缠身。身在商场，不可恋家，否则将会使我思想浑浊。另一方面，当我与家人同处时，一定得把工作留在门外，否则会使家人感到冷落。

[4:17]

There is no room in the market place for my family, nor is there room in my home for the market.  Each I will divorce from the other and thus will I remain wedded to both. Separate must they remain or my career will die. This is a paradox of the ages. 

商场上没有一块属于家人的地方，同样，家中也没有谈论商务的地方，这两者必须截然分开，否则就会顾此失彼，这是很多人难以走出的误区．

[4:18]

I am nature's greatest miracle. 

我是自然界最伟大的奇迹。

[4:19]

I have been given eyes to see and a mind to think and now I know a great secret of life for I perceive, at last, that all my problems, discouragements, and heartaches are, in truth, great opportunities  in disguise. I will no longer be fooled by the garments they wear for mine eyes are open. I will look beyond the cloth and I will not be deceived. 

我有双眼，可以观察；我有头脑，可以思考。现在，我已洞悉了一个人生中伟大的奥秘。我发现，一切问题、沮丧、悲伤，都是乔装打扮的机遇之神。我不再被他们的外表所蒙骗，我已睁开双眼，看破了他们的伪装。

[4:20]

I am nature's greatest miracle. 

我是自然界最伟大的奇迹．

[4:21]

No beast, no plant, no wind, no rain, no rock, no lake had the same beginning as I, for I was conceived in love and brought forth with a purpose.  In the past I have not considered this fact but it will henceforth shape and guide my life. 

飞禽走兽、花草树木、风雨山石、河流湖泊，都没有像我一样的起源，我孕育在爱中，肩负使命而生。过去，我忽略了这个事实，从今往后，它将塑造我的性格，引导我的人生。

[4:22]

I am nature's greatest miracle. 

我是自然界最伟大的奇迹。

[4:23]

And nature knows not defeat. Eventually, she emerges victorious and so will I, and with each victory the next struggle becomes less difficult. 

自然界不知何谓失败，终以胜利者的姿态出现，我也要如此，因为成功一旦降临，就会再度光顾。

[4:24]

I will win, and I will become a great salesman, for I am unique. 

我会成功，我会成为伟大的推销员，因为我举世无双。

[4:25]

I am nature's greatest miracle.

我是自然界最伟大的奇迹。
