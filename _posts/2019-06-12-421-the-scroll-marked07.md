The Scroll Marked Seven

第七道羊皮卷

[7:1]

I will laugh at the world. 

我笑遍世界。

[7:2]

No living creature can laugh except man. Trees may bleed when they are wounded, and beasts in the field will cry in pain and hunger, yet only I have the gift of laughter and it is mine to use whenever I choose. Henceforth I will cultivate the habit of laughter. 

只有人类才会笑。树木受伤时也会流血，禽兽也会因痛苦和饥饿而哭嚎悲鸣，然而，只有我才具备笑的天赋，可以随时开怀大笑。从今往后，我要培养笑的习惯。

[7:3]

I will smile and my digestion will improve; I will chuckle and my burdens will be lightened; I will laugh and my life will be lengthened for this is the great secret of long life and now it is mine. 

笑有助于消化，笑能减轻压力，笑是长寿的秘方。现在我终于掌握了它。

[7:4]

I will laugh at the world. 

我要笑遍世界。

[7:5]

And most of all, I will laugh at myself for man is most comical when he takes himself too seriously. Never will I fall into this trap of the mind. For though I be nature's greatest miracle am I not still a mere grain tossed about by the winds of time? Do I truly know whence I came or whither I am bound? Will my concern for this day not seem foolish ten years hence? Why should I permit the petty happenings of today to disturb me? What can take place before this sun sets which will not seem insignificant in the river of centuries? 

我笑自己，因为自视甚高的人往往显得滑稽。千万不能跌进这个精神陷阱，虽说我是造物主最伟大的奇迹，我不也是沧海一栗吗？我真的知道自己从哪儿来，到哪儿去吗？我现在所关心的事情，十年后看来，不显得愚蠢吗？为什么我要让现在发生的微不足道的琐事烦扰我？在这漫漫的历史长河中，能留下多少日落的记忆？

[7:6]

I will laugh at the world. 

我要笑遍世界。

[7:7]

And how can I laugh when confronted with man or deed which offends me so as to bring forth my tears or my curses? Four words I will train myself to say until they become a habit so strong that immediately they will appear in my mind whenever good humor threatens to depart from me. These words, passed down from the ancients, will carry me through every adversity and maintain my life in balance. These four words are: This too shall pass. 

当我受到别人的冒犯时，当我遇到不如意的事情时，我只会流泪诅咒，却怎么笑得出来？有一句至理名言，我要反复练习，直到它们深入我的骨髓，出口成言，让我永远保持良好的心境。这句话，传自远古时代，它们将伴我度过难关，使我的生活保持平衡。这句至理名言就是：这一切都会过去。

[7:8]

I will laugh at the world. 

我要笑遍世界。

[7:9]

For all worldly things shall indeed pass. When I am heavy with heartache I shall console myself that this too shall pass; when I am puffed with success I shall warn myself that this too shall pass. When I am strangled in poverty I shall tell myself that this too shall pass; when I am burdened with wealth I shall tell myself that this too shall pass. Yea, verily, where is he who built the pyramid? Is he not buried within its stone? And will the pyramid, one day, not also be buried under sand? If all things shall pass why should I be of concern for today? 

世上种种到头来都会成为过去。心力衰竭时，我安慰自己，这一切都会过去；当我因成功洋洋得意时，我提醒自己，这一切都会过去；穷困潦倒时，我告诉自己，这一切都会过去；腰缠万贯时，我也告诉自己，这一切都会过去。是的，昔日修筑金字塔的人早已作古，埋在冰冷的石头下面，而金字塔有朝一日，也会埋在沙土下面。如果世上种种终必成空，我又为何对今天的得失斤斤计较？

[7:10]

I will laugh at the world. 

我要笑遍世界。

[7:11]

I will paint this day with laughter; I will frame this night in song. Never will I labor to be happy; rather will I remain too busy to be sad. I will enjoy today's happiness today. It is not grain to be stored in a box. It is not wine to be saved in a jar. It cannot be saved for the morrow. It must be sown and reaped on the same day and this I will do, henceforth. 

我要用笑声点缀今天，我要用歌声照亮黑夜。我不再苦苦寻觅快乐，我要在繁忙的工作中忘记悲伤。我要享受今天的快乐，它不像粮食可以贮藏，更不似美酒越陈越香。我不是为将来而活。今天播种今天收获。

[7:12]

I will laugh at the world. 

我要笑遍世界。

[7:13]

And with my laughter all things will be reduced to their proper size. I will laugh at my failures and they will vanish in clouds of new dreams; I will laugh at my successes and they will shrink to their true value. I will laugh at evil and it will die untasted; I will laugh at goodness and it will thrive and abound. Each day will be triumphant only when my smiles bring forth smiles from others and this l do in selfishness, for those on whom l flown are those who purchase not my goods. 

笑声中，一切都显露本色。我笑自己的失败，它们将化为梦的云彩；我笑自己的成功，它们恢复本来面目；我笑邪恶，它们远我而去；我笑善良，它们发扬光大。我要用我的笑容感染别人，虽然我的目的自私，但这的确是成功之道，因为皱起的眉头会让顾客弃我而去。

[7:14]

I will laugh at the world. 

我要笑遍世界。

[7:15]

Henceforth will l shed only tears of sweat, for those of sadness or remorse or frustration are of no value in the market place whilst each smile can be exchanged for gold and each kind word, spoken from my heart, can build a castle. 

从今往后，我只因幸福而落泪，因为悲伤、悔恨、挫折的泪水在商场上毫无价值，只有微笑可以换来财富，善言可以建起一座城堡。

[7:16]

Never will l allow myself to become so important, so wise, so dignified, so powerful, that I forget how to laugh at myself and my world. In this matter I will always remain as a child, for only as a cl1ild am I given the ability to look up to others; and so long as I 1ook up to another I will never grow too long for my cot. 

我不再允许自己因为变得重要、聪明、体面、强大，而忘记如何嘲笑自己和周围的一切。在这一点上，我要永远像小孩子一样，因为只有做回小孩，我才能尊敬别人，尊敬别人，我才不会自以为是。

[7:17]

I will laugh at the world. 

我要笑遍世界。

[7:18]

And so long as I can laugh never will I be poor. This, then, is one of nature's greatest gifts, and l will waste it no more. Only with laughter and happiness can l truly become a success. Only with laughter and happiness can I enjoy the fruits of my labor. Were it not so, far better would it be to fail, for happiness is the wine that sharpens the taste of the meal. To enjoy success I must have happiness, and laughter will be the maiden who serves me. 

只要我能笑，就永远不会贫穷。这也是天赋，我不再浪费它。只有在笑声和快乐中，我才能真正体会到成功的滋味。只有在笑声和快乐中，我才能享受到劳动的果实。如果不这样的话，我会失败，因为快乐是提味的美酒佳酿。要想享受成功，必须先有快乐，而笑声便是那伴娘。

[7:19]

I will be happy. 

我要快乐。 

[7:20]

I will be successful. 

我要成功。

[7:21]

I will be the greatest salesman the world has ever known.

我要成为世上最伟大的推销员。
