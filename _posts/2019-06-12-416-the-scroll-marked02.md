The Scroll Marked Two

第二道羊皮卷

[2:1]

I will greet this day with love in my heart.

我要用全身心的爱来迎接今天。

[2:2]

For this is the greatest secret of success in all ventures. Muscle can split a shield and even destroy life but only the unseen power of love can open the hearts of men and until I master this art I will remain no more than a peddler in the market place. I will make love my greatest weapon and none on whom I call can defend against its force.

因为，这是一切成功的最大秘密。强力能够劈开一块盾牌，甚至毁灭生命，但是只有爱才具有无与伦比的力量，使人们敞开心扉。在掌握了爱的艺术之前，我只算商场上的无名小卒。我要让爱成为我最大的武器，没有人能抵挡它的威力。

[2:3]

My reasoning they may counter; my speech they may distrust; my apparel they may disapprove; my face they may reject; and even my bargains may cause them suspicion; yet my love will melt all hearts liken to the sun whose rays soften the coldest clay.

我的理论，他们也许反对；我的言行，他们也许怀疑；我的穿着，他们也许不赞成；我的长相，他们也许不喜欢；甚至我廉价出售的商品都可能使他们将信将疑，然而我的爱心一定能温暖他们，就像太阳的光芒能溶化冰凉的冻土。

[2:4]

I will greet this day with love in my heart.

我要用全身心的爱来迎接今天。

[2:5]

And how will I do this? Henceforth will I look on all things with love and I will be born again. I will love the sun for it warms my bones; yet I will love the rain for it cleanses my spirit. I will love the light for it shows me the way; yet I will love the darkness for it shows me the stars. I will welcome happiness for it enlarges my heart; yet I will endure sadness for it opens my soul. I will acknowledge rewards for they are my due; yet I will welcome obstacles for they are my challenge.

我该怎样做呢？从今往后，我对一切都要充满爱心，这样才能获得新生。我爱太阳，它温暖我的身体；我爱雨水，它洗净我的灵魂；我爱阳光，它为我指引道路；我也爱黑夜，它让我看到星辰；我迎接快乐，它使我心胸开阔；我忍受悲伤，它升华我的灵魂；我接受报酬，因为我为此付出汗水；我不怕困难，因为它们给我挑战。

[2:6]

I will greet this day with love in my heart.

我要用全身心的爱来迎接今天。

[2:7]

And how will I speak? I will laud mine enemies and they will become friends; I will encourage my friends and they will become brothers. Always will I dig for reasons to applaud; never will I scratch for excuses to gossip. When I am tempted to criticize I will bite on my tongue; when I am moved to praise I will shout from the roofs.

我该怎么说呢？我赞美敌人，敌人于是成为朋友；我鼓励朋友，朋友于是成为手足。我要常想理由赞美别人，绝不搬弄是非，道人长短。想要批评人时，咬住舌头，想要赞美人时，高声表达。

[2:8]

Is it not so that birds, the wind, the sea and all nature speaks with the music of praise for their creator? Cannot I speak with the same music to his children? Henceforth will I remember this secret and it will change my life.

飞鸟，清风，海浪，自然界的万物不都在用美妙动听的歌声来赞美造物主吗？我也要同样的歌声赞美我的儿女。从今往后，我要记住这个秘密。它将改变我的生活。

[2:9]

I will greet this day with love in my heart.

我要用全身心的爱来迎接今天。

[2:10]

And how will I act? I will love all manners of men for each has qualities to be admired even though they be hidden. With love I will tear down the wall fo suspicion and  hate which they have built round their hearts and in its place will I build bridges so that my love may enter their souls.

我该怎么行动呢？我要爱每个人的言谈举止，因为人人都有值得钦佩的性格，虽然有时不易察觉。我要用爱摧毁困住人们心灵的高墙，那充满怀疑与仇恨的围墙。我要铺一座通向人们心灵的桥梁。

[2:11]

I will love the ambitious for they can inspire me! I will love the failures for they can teach me. I will love the kings for they are but human; I will love the meek for they are divine. I will love the rich for they are yet lonely; I will love the poor for they are so many. I will love the young for the faith they hold; I will love the beautiful for their eyes of sadness; I will love the ugly for their souls of peace.

我爱雄心勃勃的人，他们给我灵感；我爱失败的人，他们给我教训；我爱王侯将相，因为他们也是凡人；我爱谦逊之人，因为他们非凡；我爱富人，因为他们孤独；我爱穷人，因为穷人太多了；我爱少年，因为他们真诚；我爱长者，因为他们有智慧；我爱美丽的人，因为他们眼中流露着凄迷；我爱丑陋的人，因为他们有颗宁静的心。

[2:12]

I will greet this day with love in my heart.

我要用全身心的爱来迎接今天。

[2:13]

But how will I react to the actions of others? With love. For just as love is my weapon to open the hearts of men, love is also my shield to repulse the arrows of hate and the spears of anger. Adversity and discouragement will beat against my new shield and become as the softest of rains. My shield will protect me in the market place and sustain me when I am alone. It will uplift me in moments of despair yet it will calm me in time of exultation. It will become stronger and more protective with use until one day I will cast it aside and walk unencumbered among all manners of men and, when I do, my name will be raised high on the pyramid of life.

我该怎样回应他人的行为呢？用爱心。爱是我打开人们心扉的钥匙，也是我抵挡仇恨之箭与愤怒之矛的盾牌。爱使挫折变得如春雨般温和，它是我商场上的护身符。孤独时，给我支持；绝望时，使我振作；狂喜时，让我平静。这种爱心会一天天加强。越发具有保护力，直到有一天,我可以自然地面对芸芸众生，处事泰然。

[2:14]

I will greet this day with love in my heart.

我要用全身心的爱来迎接今天。

[2:15]

And how will I confront each whom I meet? In only one way. In silence and to myself I will address him and say I Love You. Though spoken in silence these words will shine in my eyes, unwrinkle my brow, bring a smile to my lips, and echo in my voice; and hisheart will be opened. And who is there who will say nay to my goods when his heart feels my love?

我该怎样面对遇到的每一个人呢？只有一种办法，我要在心里默默地为他祝福。这无言的爱会闪现在我的眼神里，流露在我的眉宇间，让我嘴角挂上微笑，在我的声音里响着共鸣。在这无声的爱意里，他的心扉问我敞开，他不再拒绝我推销的货物。

[2:16]

I will greet this day with love in my heart.

我要用全身心的爱来迎接今天。

[2:17]

And most of all I will love myself. For when I do I will zealously inspect all things which enter my body, my mind, my soul, and my heart. Never will I overindulge the requests of my flesh, rather I will cherish my body with cleanliness and moderation. Never will I allow my mind to be attracted to evil and despair, rather I will uplift it with the knowledge and wisdom of the ages. Never will I allow my soul to become complacent and satisfied, rather I will feed it with meditation and prayer. Never will I allow my heart to become small and bitter, rather I will share it and it will grow and warm the earth.

最主要的，我要爱自己。只有这样，我才会认真检查进入我的身体，思想，精神，头脑，灵魂，心怀的一切东西。我绝不放纵肉体的需求，我要用清洁与节制来珍惜我的身体。我绝不让头脑受到邪恶与绝望的引诱，我要用智慧和知识使之升华。我绝不让灵魂陷入自满的状态，我要用深思和祈祷来滋润它。我绝不让心怀狭窄，我要与人分享，让它成长，温暖整个世界。

[2:18]

I will greet this day with love in my heart.

我要用全身心的爱来迎接今天。

[2:19]

Henceforth will I love all mankind. From this moment all hate is let from my veins for I have no time to hate, only time to love. From this moment I take the first step required to become a man among men. With love I will increase my sales a hundredfold and become a great salesman. If I have no other qualities I can succeed with love alone. Without it I will fail though I possess all the knowledge and skills of the world.

从今往后，我要爱所有的人。仇恨将从我的血管中流走。我没有时间去恨，只有时间去爱。现在，我迈出成为一个优秀的人的第一步。有了爱，我将成为伟大的推销员，即使才疏智短，也能以爱心获得成功；相反地，如果没有爱，即使博学多识，也终将失败。

[2:20]

I will greet this day with love, and I will succeed.

我要用全身心的爱来迎接今天。
