The Scroll Marked Three

第三道羊皮卷

[3:1]

I will persist until I succeed.

坚持不懈。直到成功。

[3:2]

In the Orient young bulls are tested for the fight arena in a certain manner. Each is brought to the ring and allowed to attack a picador who pricks them with a lance. The bravery of each bull is then rated with care according to the number of times he demonstrates his willingness to charge in spite of the sting of the blade. Henceforth will I recognize that each day I am tested by life in like manner. If I persist, if I continue to try, if I continue to charge forward, I will succeed.

在古老的东方，挑选小公牛列竞技场格斗有一定的程序，它们被带进场地，向手持长矛的斗士攻击，裁判以它受挫后再向斗牛士进攻的次数多寡来评定这只公牛的勇敢程度。从今往后，我须承认，我的生命每天都在接受类似的考验。如果我坚韧不拔，勇往直前，迎接挑战。那么，我一定会成功。

[3:3]

I will persist until I succeed.

坚持不懈，直到成功。

[3:4]

I was not delivered unto this world in defeat, nor does failure course in my veins. I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd. I am a lion and I refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with the sheep. I will hear not those who weep and complain, for their disease is contagious. Let them join the sheep. The slaughterhouse of failure is not my destiny.

我不是为了失败才来到这个世界上的，我的血管里也没有失败的血液在流动。我不是任人鞭打的羔羊，我是猛狮，不与羊群为伍。我不想听失意者的哭泣，抱怨者的牢骚，这是羊群中的瘟疫，我不能让它传染。失败者的屠宰场不是我命运的归宿。

[3:5]

I will persist until I succeed.

坚持不懈，直到成功。

[3:6]

The prizes of life are at the end of each journey, not near the beginning; and it is not given to me to know how many steps are necessary in order to reach my goal. Failure I may still encounter at the thousandth step, yet success hides behind the next bend in the road. Never will I know how close it lies unless I turn the corner.

生命的奖赏远在旅途终点，而非起点附近。我不知道要走多少步才能达到目标。踏上第一千步的时候，仍然可能遭到失败。但成功就藏在拐角后面，除非拐了弯，我永远不知道还有多远。

[3:7]

Always will I take another step. If that is of no avail I will take another, and yet another. In truth, one step at a time is not too difficult.

再前进一步，如果没有用，就再向前一点儿。事实上，每次进步一点点并不太难。

[3:8]

I will persist until I succeed.

坚持不懈，直到成功。

[3:9]

Henceforth, I will consider each day's effort as but one blow of my blade against a mighty oak. The first blow may cause not a tremor in the wood, nor the second, nor the third. Each blow, of itself, may be trifling, and seem of no consequence. Yet from childish swipes the oak will eventually tumble. So it will be with my efforts of today.

从今往后，我承认每天的奋斗就像对参天大树的一次砍击，头几刀可能了无痕迹。每一击者似微不足道，然而，累积起来，巨树终会倒下。这恰如我今天的努力。 就像冲洗高山的雨滴，吞噬猛虎的蚂蚁，照亮大地的星辰，建起金字塔的奴隶，

[3:10]

I will be liken to the raindrop which washes away the mountain; the ant who devours a tiger; the star which brightens the earth; the slave who builds a pyramid. I will build my castle one brick at a time for I know that small attempts, repeated, will complete any undertaking.

我也要一砖一瓦地建造起自己的城堡，因为我深知水滴石穿的道理，只要持之以恒，什么都可以做到。

[3:11]

I will persist until I succeed.

坚持不懈，直到成功。

[3:12]

I will never consider defeat and I will remove from my vocabulary such words and phrases as quit, cannot, unable, impossible, out of the question, improbable, failure, unworkable, hopeless, and retreat; for they are the words of fools. I will avoid despair but if this disease of the mind should infect me then I will work on in despair. I will toil and I will endure. I will ignore the obstacles at my feet and keep mine eyes on the goals above my head, for I know that where dry desert ends, green grass grows.

我绝不考虑失败，我的字典里不再有放弃，不可能、办不到、没法子、成问题、失败、行不通、没希望、退缩…这类愚蠢的字眼。我要尽量避免绝望，一旦受到它的威胁，立即想方设法向它挑战。我要辛勤耕耘，忍受苦楚。我放眼未来，勇往直前，不再理会脚下的障碍。我坚信，沙漠尽头必是绿洲。

[3:13]

I will persist until I succeed.

坚持不懈，直到成功。

[3:14]

I will remember the ancient law of averages and I will bend it to my good. I will persist with knowledge that each failure to sell will increase my chance for success at the next attempt. Each nay I hear will bring me closer to the sound of yea. Each frown I meet only prepares me for the smile to come. Each misfortune I encounter will carry in it the seed of tomorrow's good luck. I must have the night to appreciate the day. I must fail often to succeed only once.

我要牢牢记住古老的平衡法则，鼓励自己坚持下去，因为每一次的失败都会增加下一次成功的机会。这一次的拒绝就是下一次的赞同，这一次皱起的眉头就是下一次舒展的笑容。今天的不幸，往往预示着明天的好运。夜幕降临。回想一天的遭遇。我总是心存感激。我深知，只有失败多次，才能成功。

[3:15]

I will persist until I succeed.

坚持不懈，直到成功。

[3:16]

I will try, and try, and try again. Each obstacle I will consider as a mere detour to my goal and a challenge to my profession. I will persist and develop my skills as the mariner develops his, by learning to ride out the wrath of each storm.

我要尝试，尝试，再尝试。障碍是我成功路上的弯路，我迎接这项挑战。我要像水手一样，乘风破浪。

[3:17]

I will persist until I succeed.

坚持不懈，直到成功。

[3:18]

Henceforth, I will learn and apply another secret of those who excel in my work. When each day is ended, not regarding whether it has been a success or a failure, I will attempt to achieve one more sale. When my thoughts beckon my tired body homeward I will resist the temptation to depart. I will try again. I will make one more attempt to close with victory, and if that fails I will make another. Never will I allow any day to end with a failure. Thus will I plant the seed of tomorrow's success and gain an insurmountable advantage over those who cease their labor at a prescribed time. When others cease their struggle, the mine will begin, and my harvest will be full.

从今往后，我要借鉴别人成功的秘诀。过去的是非成败，我全不计较，只抱定信念，明天会更好。当我精疲力歇时，我要抵制回家的诱惑，再试一次，我一试再试。争取每一天的成功，避免以失败收场。我要为明天的成功播种，超过那些按部就班的人。在别人停滞不前时，我继续拼搏，终有一天我会丰收。

[3:19]

Nor will I allow yesterday's success to lull me into today's complacency, for this is the great foundation of failure. I will forget the happenings of the day that is gone, whether they were good or bad, and greet the new sun with confidence that this will be the best day of my life.

我不因昨日的成功而满足，因为这是失败的先兆。我要忘却昨日的一切，是好是坏，都让它随风而去。我信心百倍，迎接新的太阳，相信"今天是此生最好的一天"。

[3:20]

So long as there is breath in me, that long will I persist. For now I know one of the greatest principles of success; if I persist long enough I will win.

只要我一息尚存，就要坚持到底，因为我已深知成功的秘诀：

[3:21]

I will persist. I will win.

坚持不懈，终会成功。
