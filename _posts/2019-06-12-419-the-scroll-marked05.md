第五道羊皮卷

[5:1]

I will live this day as if it is my last.

假如今天是我生命中的最后一天。

[5:2]

And what shall I do with this last precious day which remains in my keeping? First, I will seal up its container of life so that not one drop spills itself upon the sand. I will waste not a moment mourning yesterday’s misfortunes, yesterday’s defeats, yesterday's aches of the heart, for why should I throw good after bad?

我要如何利用这最后，最宝贵的一天呢？首先，我要把一天的时间珍藏好，不让一分一秒的时间滴漏。不为昨日的不幸叹息，过去的已够不幸，不要再赔上今天的运道。

[5:3]

Can sand flow upward in the hour glass? Will the sun rise where it sets and set where it rises? Can I relive the errors of yesterday and right them? Can I call back yesterday's wounds and make them whole? Can I become younger than yesterday? Can I take back the evil that was spoken, the blows that were struck, the pain that was caused? No. Yesterday is buried forever and I will think of it no more.

时光会倒流吗？太阳会西起东落吗？我可以纠正昨天的错误吗？我能扶平昨日的创伤吗？我能比昨天年轻吗？一句出口的恶言，一记挥出的拳头，一切造成的伤痛，能收回吗？不能！过去的永远过去了，我不再去想它。

[5:4]

I will live this day as if it is my last.

假如今天是我生命中的最后一天。

[5:5]

And what then shall I do? Forgetting yesterday neither will I think of tomorrow. Why should I throw note after maybe? Can tomorrow's sand flow through the glass before today's? Will the sun rise twice this morning? Can I perform tomorrow's deeds while standing in today's path? Can I place tomorrow's gold in today's purse? Can tomorrow’s child be born today? Can tomorrow's death cast its shadow backward and darken today's joy? Should I concern myself over events which l may never witness? Should I torment myself with problems that may never come to pass? No! Tomorrow lies buried with yesterday, and I will think of it no more.

我该怎么办？忘记昨天，也不要痴想明天。明天是一个未知数，为什么要把今天的精力浪费在未知的事上？想着明天的种种，今天的时光也白白流逝了。企盼今早的太阳再次升起，太阳已经落山。走在今天的路上，能做明天的事吗?我能把明天的金币放进今天的钱袋里吗？明日瓜熟，今日能落地吗？明天的死亡能将今天的欢乐蒙上阴影吗？我能杞人忧天吗？明天和昨天一样被我埋葬，我不再想它。

[5:6]

I will live this day as if it is my last.

今天是我生命中的最后一天。

[5:7]

This day is all I have and these hours are now my eternity. I greet this sunrise with cries of joy as a prisoner who is reprieved from death. I lift mine arms with thanks for this priceless gift of a new day. So too, I will beat upon my heart with gratitude as I consider all who greeted yesterday's sunrise who are no longer with the living today. I am indeed a fortunate man and today's hours are but a bonus, undeserved. Why have I been allowed to live this extra day when others, far better than I, have departed? Is it that they have accomplished their purpose while mine is yet to be achieved? Is this another opportunity for me to become the man I know I can be? Is there a purpose in nature? Is this my day to excel?

这是我仅有的一天，是现实的永恒。我像被赦免死刑的囚犯，用喜悦的泪水拥抱新生的太阳。我举起双手，感谢这无与伦比的一天。当我想到昨天和我一起迎接日出的朋友，今天已不复存在时，我为自己的幸存，感激上苍。我是无比幸运的人，今天的时光是额外的奖赏。许多强者都先我而去，为什么我得到这额外的一天？是不是因为他们已大功告成，而我尚在途中跋涉？如果这样，这是不是成就我的一次机会，让我功德圆满？造物主的安排是否别具匠心？今天是不是我超越他人的机会？

[5:8]

I will live this day as if it is my last. 

今天是我生命中的最后一天。

[5:9]

I have but one life and life is naught but a measurement of time. When I waste one I destroy the other. If I waste today I destroy the last page of my life. Therefore, each hour of this day will I cherish for it can never return. It cannot be banked today to be withdrawn on the morrow, for who can trap the wind? Each minute of this day will I grasp with both hands and fondle with love for its value is beyond price. What dying man can purchase another breath though he willingly give all his gold? What price dare I place on the hours ahead? I will make them priceless!

生命只有一次，而人生也不过是时间的累积。我若让今天的时光白白流逝，就等于毁掉入生最后一页。因此，我珍惜今天的一分一秒，因为它们将一去不复返。我无法把今天存入银行，明天再来取用。时间像风一样不可捕捉。每一分一秒，我要用双手捧住，用爱心抚慰，因为它们如此宝贵。垂死的人用毕生的钱财都无法换得一口生气。我无法计算时间的价值，它们是无价之宝；

[5:10]

I will live this day as if it is my last. 

今天是我生命中的最后一天。

[5:11]

I will avoid with fury the killers of time. Procrastination I will destroy with action; doubt I will bury under faith; fear I will dismember with confidence. Where there are idle mouths I will listen not; where there are idle hands I will linger not; where there are idle bodies I will visit not. Henceforth I know that to court idleness is to steal food, clothing, and warmth from those I love. I am not a thief. I am a man of love and today is my last chance to prove my love and my greatness.

我憎恨那些浪费时间的行为．我要摧毁拖延的习惯。我要以真诚埋葬怀疑，用信心驱赶恐惧。我不听闲话、不游手好闲，不与不务正业的人来往。我终于醒悟到，若是懒惰，无异于从我所心爱的人手中窃取食物和衣裳。我不是贼，我有爱心，今天是我最后的机会，我要证明我的爱心和伟大。

[5:12]

I will live this day as if it is my last.

今天是我生命中的最后一天。

[5:13]

The duties of today I shall fu1fill today. Today I shall fondle my children while they are young; tomorrow they will be gone, and so will I. Today I shall embrace my woman with sweet kisses; tomorrow she will be gone, and so will I. Today I shall lift up a friend in need; tomorrow he will no longer cry for help, nor will I hear his cries. Today I shall give myself in sacrifice and work; tomorrow I will have nothing to give, and there will be none to receive.

今日事今日毕。今天我要趁孩子还小的时候，多加爱护，明天他们将离我而去，我也会离开。今天我要深情地拥抱我的妻子，给她甜蜜的热吻，明天她会离去，我也是。今天我要帮助落难的朋友，明天他不再求援，我也听不到他的哀求。我要乐于奉献，因为明天我无法给予，也没有人来领受了。

[5:14]

I will live this day as if it is my last.

今天是我生命中的最后一天。

[5:15]

And if it is my last, it will be my greatest monument. This day I will make the best day of my life. This day I will drink every minute to its full. I will savor its taste and give thanks. I will make the every hour count and each minute I will trade only for something of value. I will labor harder than ever before and push my muscles until they cry for relief, and then I will continue. I will make more calls than ever before. I will sell more goods than ever before. I will earn more gold than ever before. Each minute of today will be more fruitful than hours of yesterday. My last must be my best. 

如果这是我的末日，那么它就是不朽的纪念日，我把它当成最美好的日子。我要把每分每秒化为甘露，一口一口，细细品尝，满怀感激。我要每一分钟都有价值。我要加倍努力，直到精疲力竭。即使这样，我还要继续努力。我要拜访更多的顾客，销售更多的货物，赚取更多的财富。今天的每一分钟都胜过昨天的每一小时，最后的也是最好的。

[5:16]

I will live this day as if it is my last. 

假如今天是我生命中的最后一天。

[5:17]

And if it is not, I shall fall to my knees and give thanks.

如果不是的话，我要跪倒在上苍面前，深深致谢。
