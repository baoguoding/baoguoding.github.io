The Scroll Marked Eight

第八道羊皮卷

[8:1]

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold. 

今天我要加倍重视自己的价值。

[8:2]

A mulberry leaf touched with the genius of man becomes silk. 

桑叶在天才的手中变成丝绸。

[8:3]

A field of clay touched with the genius of man becomes a castle. 

粘土在天才的手中变成堡垒。

[8:4]

A Cyprus tree touched with the genius of man becomes a shrine. 

柏树在天才的手中变成殿堂。

[8:5]

A cut of sheep's hair touched with the genius of man becomes raiment for a king. 

羊毛在天才的手中变成袈裟。

[8:6]

If it is possible for leaves and clay and wood and hair to have their value multiplied a hundred, yea a thousandfold by man, cannot I do the same with the clay which bears my name? 

如果桑叶、粘土、柏树、羊毛经过人的创造，可以成百上千倍地提高自身的价值，那么我为什么不能使自己身价百倍呢？

[8:7]

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold. 

今天我要加倍重视自己的价值。

[8:8]

I am liken to a grain of wheat which faces one of three futures. The wheat can be placed in a sack and dumped in a stall until it is fed to swine. Or it can be ground to flour and made into bread. Or it can be placed in the earth and allowed to grow until its golden head divides and produces a thousand grains from the one. 

我的命运如同一颗麦粒，有着三种不同的道路。一颗麦粒可以被装进麻袋，堆在货架上，等着喂猪；也可能被磨成面粉，做成面包；还可能撒在土壤里，让它生长，直到金黄色的麦穗上结出成百上千颗麦粒。

[8:9]

I am liken to a grain of wheat with one difference. The wheat cannot choose whether it be fed to swine, ground for bread, or planted to multiply. I have a choice and I will not let my life be fed to swine nor will I let it be ground under the rocks of failure and despair to be broken open and devoured by the will of others. 

我和一颗麦粒唯一不同的在于，麦粒无法选择是变得腐烂还是做成面包，或者种植生长。而我有选择的自由，我不会让生命腐烂，也不会让它在失败、绝望的岩石下磨碎，任人摆布。

[8:10]

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold. 

今天我要加倍重视自己的价值。

[8:11]

To grow and multiply it is necessary to plant the wheat grain in the darkness of the earth and my failures, my despairs, my ignorance, and my inabilities are the darkness in which I have been planted in order to ripen. Now, like the wheat grain which will sprout and blossom only if it is nurtured with rain and sun and warm winds, I too must nurture my body and mind to fulfill my dreams. But to grow to full stature the wheat must wait on the whims of nature. I need not wait for I have the power to choose my own destiny. 

我想让麦粒生长、结实，必须把它种植在黑暗的泥土中，我的失败、失望、无知、无能便是那黑暗的泥土，我须深深地扎在泥土中，等待成熟。麦粒在阳光雨露的哺育下，终将发芽、开花、结实。同样，我也要健全自己的身体和心灵，以实现自己的梦想。麦粒须等待大自然的契机方能成熟，我却无须等待，因为我有选择自己命运的能力。

[8:12]

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold. 

今天我要加倍重视自己的价值。

[8:13]

And how will I accomplish this? First I will set goals for the day, the week, the month, the year, and my life. Just as the rain must fall before the wheat will crack its shell and sprout, so must I have objectives before my life will crystallize. Insetting my goals I will consider my best performance of the past and multiply it a hundredfold. This will be the standard by which I will live in the future. Never will I be of concern that my goals are too high for is it not better to aim my spear at the moon and strike only an eagle than to arm my spear at the eagle and strike only a rock? 

怎样才能做到呢？首先，我要为每一天、每个星期、每个月、每一年、甚至我的一生确定目标。正像种子需要雨水的滋润才能破土而出，发芽长叶，我的生命也须有目标方能结出硕果。在制定目标的时候，不妨参考过去最好的成绩，使其发扬光大。这必须成为我未来生活的目标。永远不要担心目标过高。取法乎上，得其中也，取法乎中，得其下也。

[8:14]

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold. 

今天我要加倍重视自己的价值。

[8:15]

The height of my goals will not hold me in awe though I may stumble often before they are reached. If I stumble I will rise and my falls will not concern me for all men must stumble often to reach the hearth. Only a worm is free from the worry of stumbling. I am not a worm. I am not an onion plant. I am not a sheep. I am a man. Let others build a cave with their clay. I will build a castle with mine. 

高远的目标不会让我望而生畏，虽然在达到目标以前可能屡受挫折。摔倒了，再爬起来，我不灰心因为每个人在抵达目标前都会受到挫折。只有小爬虫不必担心摔倒。我不是小爬虫，不是洋葱，不是绵羊。我是一个人。让别人挖他们的粘土造洞穴吧，我只要建一座城堡。

[8:16]

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold. 

今天我要加倍重视自己的价值。

[8:17]

And just as the sun must warm the earth to bring forth the seedling of wheat so, too, will the words on these scrolls warm my life and turn my dreams into reality. Today I will surpass every action which I performed yesterday. I will climb today's mountain to the utmost of my ability yet tomorrow I will climb higher than today, and the next will be higher than tomorrow. To surpass the deeds of others is unimportant; to surpass my own deeds is all. 

太阳温暖大地，麦粒吐穗结实。这些羊皮卷上的话也会照耀我的生活，使梦想成真。今天我要超越昨日的成就。我要竭尽全力攀登今天的高峰，明天更上一层楼。超越别人并不重要，超越自己才是最重要的。

[8:18]

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold. 

今天我要加倍重视自己的价值。

[8:19]

And just as the warm wind guides the wheat to maturity, the same winds will carry my voice to those who will listen and my words will announce my goals. Once spoken I dare not recall them lest I lose face. I will be as my own prophet and though all may laugh at my utterances they will hear my plans, they will know my dreams; and thus there will be no escape for me until my words become accomplished deeds. 

春风吹熟了麦穗，风声也将我的声音吹往那些愿意聆听者的耳畔。我要宣布自己的目标。君子一言，驷马难追。我要成为自己的预言家。虽然大家可能嘲笑我的言辞但会倾听我的计划，了解我的梦想，因此我无处可逃，直到兑现了诺言。

[8:20]

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold. 

今天我要加倍重视自己的价值。

[8:21]

I will commit not the terrible crime of aiming too low. 

我不能放低目标。

[8:22]

I will do the work that a failure will not do. 

我要做失败者不屑一顾的事。

[8:23]

I will always let my reach exceed my grasp. 

我不停留在力所能及的事上。

[8:24]

I will never be content with my performance in the market. 

我不满足于现有的成就。

[8:25]

I will always raise my goals as soon as they are attained. 

目标达到后再定一个更高的目标。

[8:26]

I will always strive to make the next hour better than this one. 

我要努力使下一刻比此刻更好。

[8:27]

I will always announce my goals to the world. 

我要常常向世人宣告我的目标。

[8:28]

Yet, never will I proclaim my accomplishments. Let the world, instead, approach me with praise and may I have the wisdom to receive it in humility. 

但是我决不炫耀我的成绩。让世人来赞美我的吧，但愿我能明智而谦恭地接受它们。

[8:29]

Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold. 

今天我要加倍重视自己的价值。

[8:30]

One grain of wheat when multiplied a hundredfold will produce a hundred stalks. Multiply these a hundredfold, ten times, and they will feed all the cities of the earth. Am I not more than a grain of wheat? 

一颗麦粒增加数倍以后，可以变成数千株麦苗，再把这些麦苗增加数倍，如此数十次，它们可以供养世上所有的城市。难道我不如一颗麦粒儿吗？

[8:31]

And when it is done I will do it again, and again, and there will be astonishment and wonder at my greatness as the words of these scrolls are fulfilled in me.

当我完成这件事，我要再接再厉。当羊皮卷上的话在我心中实现时，世人会惊叹我的伟大。
